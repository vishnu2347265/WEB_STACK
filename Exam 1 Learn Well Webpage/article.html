<h1>New Google for Education tools for how you teach, learn and manage</h1>
<p><b> Editor’s note: </b>This week we’re joining thousands of educators and students at ISTE, the United States’ biggest educational technology exhibition. Visit us on Level 2 in the Grand Hall, where you can check out new Chromebooks and features in Google Workspace for Education, plus sign up for our deep-dive workshops. Follow along on Twitter and Facebook for the latest updates.

    At Google for Education, we're constantly working to develop new products and tools that help students learn more effectively, and help educators teach more efficiently, no matter where they are or how they teach. Part of that commitment is making sure every student and educator has access to tools that create more personal, collaborative, accessible and safe teaching and learning experiences.</p>

<h1>Made for more personal learning</h1>
<p>We believe technology in the classroom can help amplify teacher impact and improve student outcomes.

    In Google Classroom, educators will be able to help students build literacy skills with reading activities through the new Read Along integration, which makes it easier to support differentiated learning and see insights on students’ progress. Express interest in the early access program, available in English. With practice sets, educators can soon deliver more relevant student interventions by adding their own resources and managing the resources that were suggested with the help of AI. And, when educators create an assignment with a YouTube video attached, they’ll be able to add interactive questions to help students check their understanding as they watch. Educators can create their own questions, or they can select and edit questions that are suggested with the help of AI, available in English and coming soon to the beta. Express interest in the beta, available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese and Malay.
    
    On Chromebooks, Screencast is a powerful tool for teaching and learning, with new updates including demo tools and the ability to watch screencasts on any desktop or tablet with the web player. You can pair Screencast with cast moderator, which allows teachers and students to wirelessly share their screen to a central display using a secure access code.
    
    Today, we’re introducing the expanded Google for Education App Hub, a place to discover all the apps that connect with Google Workspace for Education and Chromebooks, all in one place. On the Google for Education App Hub, educators and admins alike will find apps that easily integrate into assignments in Classroom using Classroom add-ons, tools to help streamline class and grade management with SIS integrations, and apps that can be easily provisioned and managed within Google Admin Console using app licensing.</p>
